Welcome to CASPER: *Computer Architecture for Security and Performance Research* group! 

Ever wondered what components make a processor chip ? How do these components interact with each other ? What can be done to make the the processor execute your programs *faster* ? Why do we need *caches* in the memory hierarchy ? Why worry about OS-architecture interaction? Why worry about security when there are already software and OS level protection mechanisms? 

We, CASPER Research Group, are a group of folks from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in) of [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in), who ponder about similar questions and whose research includes, but is not limited to, methodologies to make the systems more robust against microarchitecture-level attacks (*Spectre* kinda) and to further improve the performance of modern-day processors! 

<!--We have a [CASPER reading group (CASPERG)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSiRqCAlb2PSE9YKY3j2NWGiQ17ywFUNLiQHvSGqc0Pv6pxA9qQT2wS_VC78OJVzaP0hLuhBPOs36Zd/pubhtml) where we present/debate/brainstorm about recent research papers related computer architecture for security and performance.  -->

The group has started in May 2021 at IIT Bombay and a lot is on the way from us... Please do get in touch with any group member for more about CASPER.
