**Welcome to CASPER: *Computer Architecture for Security and Performance Research* group!** 

News Alert: [M.S./Ph.D. admissions 2024] (https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/pw4keljiych5xww3gxzd7/CASPER-Admissions.pptx?rlkey=kiiu1uw3rva9nyn6j81wai0rr&dl=0)

Ever wondered what components make a processor chip? How do these components interact with each other? What can be done to make the processor execute your programs *faster*? Why do we need *caches* in the memory hierarchy? Why worry about OS-architecture interaction? Why worry about security when there are already software and OS-level protection mechanisms? 

We, the CASPER Research Group, are a group of passionate folks from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in) of [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in), who ponders about similar questions and whose research includes, but is not limited to, methodologies to make the systems more robust against microarchitecture-level attacks and to further improve the performance of modern-day systems! 


<!--We have a [CASPER reading group (CASPERG)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSiRqCAlb2PSE9YKY3j2NWGiQ17ywFUNLiQHvSGqc0Pv6pxA9qQT2wS_VC78OJVzaP0hLuhBPOs36Zd/pubhtml) where we present/debate/brainstorm about recent research papers related computer architecture for security and performance.  -->

CASPER is one of the groups in India that does top-quality computer architecture/systems research and publishes at flagship conferences. This ensures India's presence on the global map of computer architecture/systems research. Thanks to Qualcomm, Google Research, Intel Labs, NXP, and Trust Lab for all the support. 

{: .alert .alert-info}
We also have a weekly reading group to discuss interesting computer architecture topics. Click [here](https://casper-reading-group.carrd.co/#) for more details. 

{: .alert .alert-danger}
Join us for a monthly online talk series on top-quality computer systems research by Indian students. Click [here](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/systalksind.html) for more details.
