**Microarchitecture for Security**

- Offensive side: New microarchitecture side/covert timing channels (attacks)
- Defensive side: Mitigation techniques for transient execution attacks like Spectre and Meltdown, Flush-based, eviction-based, and Rowhammer based attacks
- Performance-Security tradeoffs: Design of secure processors (Intel SGX kinda) and memory hierarchies keeping performance and security in mind.

**Microarchitecture for Performance**
- Memory hierarchy optimizations: Data prefetching, instruction prefetching, microarchitecure-interactions, shared resource management, front-end and back-end bottleneck mitigation techniques keeping performance and power in mind
- Architecture-OS interaction: TLB/Page-table-walker optimizations, memory hierarchy for virtualization, memory hierarchy for high-speed network I/O (Intel DDIO kinda), persistent memory optimizations (Intel Optane kinda)
- ML/RL for architecture: ML/RL for microarchitecture optimizations, Application specific microarchitecture

One of the  projects back from my job-proposal is to develop nanofabricated STM tips. The idea behind these “smart tips” is to use the technologies that were developed over decades in nanofabrication and make them available for scanning probe by using a nano-device instead of the traditional STM tungsten tip. One gains the flexibility of using different functionalities that are known from the fields of nanofabrication and mesoscopic physics. We are collaborating with the group Simon Groeblacher at TU Delft to realize this concept, benefitting from their unparalleled micro/nano fabrication know how.  A prototype of a smart tip is shown to the left. See publications in Microsyst Nanoeng, Nanotechnology, and PRB. -->
